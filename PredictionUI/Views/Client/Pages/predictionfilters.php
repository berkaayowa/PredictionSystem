            <h2 class="hFocus">Available Filters</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>numberOfGamesPerCoupon:</strong>
                        This parameter allows users to specify the number of games they want to include in a single coupon or bet. It helps users create coupons with a desired quantity of matches, making the betting experience more tailored.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>numberOfGamesPerLeague:</strong>
                        Users can set a limit on how many games they want to include from a single league. This can help in diversifying bets by not focusing too heavily on a particular league.</p></li><li><p><strong>leaguePointPercentageOverOREqual:</strong> This filter takes into account the league standings and lets users select games where at least one of the teams has a certain percentage of points over a specified threshold. It could be used to identify matches where teams are performing well in their respective leagues.</p></li><li><p><strong>gameMotivation:</strong> This factor considers the motivation level of teams or players in a game. It helps users predict outcomes by taking into account factors like team rankings, rivalry, or the importance of the match in the context of the season.</p></li><li><p><strong>h2hPercentage:</strong> "h2h" stands for head-to-head, and this filter looks at the historical performance between the two teams playing against each other. Users can set a certain percentage or win ratio that a team should have against their opponent to be considered for prediction.</p></li><li><p><strong>gameLocation:</strong> This criterion considers whether the game is being played at the home stadium of one of the teams or at a neutral venue. It's known that home advantage can influence outcomes, so this filter helps users weigh this factor.</p></li><li><p><strong>allowedDuplicateGame:</strong> This option lets users decide whether they want to include duplicate games (games that are part of multiple coupons) or not. It helps in managing diversity in coupons and reducing the risk of relying too heavily on a single game.</p></li></ol>
